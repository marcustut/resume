Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing this letter to express my strong interest in the Summer Internship â€“ Core Operations Engineer (2024) role at Virtu Financial. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at University College Dublin and with a solid foundation in Rust, C++ and Python, having built automated trading infrastructure at a previous crypto quant startup. 

I was involved in building exchanges integration for the startup mostly with REST and Websocket APIs, from ingressing market data to order placement. I also have experience with Deribit's FIX API where it was used in one of my personal projects. During my time there, I have written a fair amount of low-level code involving the use of signals and threads mainly using Rust's futures and tokio libraries. In addition, I have also worked on a project where I exposed underlying Rust primitives as Python bindings through Foregin Function Interface (FFI) to allow traders to write scripts to run their trading strategies on the firm's infrastructure mainly low to mid-frequency strategies. 

To add on, I also did an internship for a Web3 startup based in Singapore previously where I helped them to build a MVP from ideation to production on the Ethereum and Polygon chain. I was involved in the design and implementation of the smart contracts using Solidity and the frontend using React / Next.js.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of Virtu Financial in more detail.

Sincerely, \
Marcus Lee.
